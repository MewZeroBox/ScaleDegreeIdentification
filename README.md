# ScaleDegreeIdentification

The purpose of the site is to help assist a friend in learning the music theory of understanding scales and scale degrees. I drew a lot of inspiration from the format of the musictheory.net website, where they host a bunch of music theory assisting exercises and lessons. This is very much a beta version of the site and a lot of functionality and editing is still being done to the site. If there are any bugs or errors you see in the code or the algorithms please notify me on github. thank you and enjoy.
